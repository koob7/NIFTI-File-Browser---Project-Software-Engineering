The NIFTI File Browser is a tool designed for browsing medical images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). It allows users to zoom in, zoom out, and navigate through the layers of the NIFTI image, which is crucial in correct analysis. Additionally, users can draw on the images, add annotations, and formulate patient diagnoses. All edits made are automatically saved using serialization, ensuring data integrity.
